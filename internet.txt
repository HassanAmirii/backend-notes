internet 
  The internet is a network of interconnected computers that communicate with each other   using standardized protocols.

standardized protocols :
   these are two words right;
   standardized: somethings we all agree on 
   protocol: rules 

so we could say sp are set of instructions agreed upon  so computers can communicate effectively

switch device 
  a device for that allows communication btw computers within the same Lan 

Lan
  local area network 


router
 delivers packets from a computer to the internet 

isp
internet service provider: basically takes your packets from the router and sends it to the final destination where the data requested are stored or to be posted and these process involve both wireless and wired connection --responsible for the transmission of packets from one location to the other


fiber optics cable
fastest data transmission device are

router table
the algorithm that decides the most efficient  path btw interconnected routers a router should transfer packets to



streaming
when packets are sent in little by little and depends heavily on your internet speed

servers
an organization dB storage 

load balancing
a way to manage heavy request to a single point from multiple computers 


Wan (wide area network)
connection of multiple lans 
the internet is made of wans cuz it is network of network 
 but not all wans makes up the internet cuz private organizations could set up their own private wan by connecting their lans



vpn - virtual private network
vpn tunnel link create privacy, anonymity, security trust over a public network
it encrypt your data sent over a publk network eeping your data secure from unautorized access

 encryption: putting data in a way unauthorized person cannt read
encapsulation : tunnel link iz  a form of encapsulation , wrapping data packets in another packets

add to add encryption


lan for switches -- more secure

wan for routers  -- less secure

public wans 
- linking up lans through the internet; which is unsecure
-could also utilize vpn to create a tunnel link -- which provides better security but still over the public internet

private wans - through isp wan network - can be costly 
these are dedicated infastructure; created through the isp, to provide a fully secured private connction to authorized hooman- basically creating a private internet 



router -- connect different network to the internet 



local isps-- a small isp serving small community 

regional isps -- sevring large city in a country

global isps -- serving internarionally

pop -- point of presence : basically connects the routers of difernt isps ; TO improve connection, data exchange and all

peering-- large companies linking a server to multiples isps for faster connections

networks of different global isps -- is called INternet backbone

ixp -- internet exchange point: are like pop but for global isps aka internet backbone to enable peering btw global isps
